#  Object-Oriented Programming, HTML TablesSas
## Domain Modeling
process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem, object-oriented model: an entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred,

# Define a constructor and initialize properties :

 Below is a table that summarizes a JavaScript representation of an EpicFailVideo object.


|  roperty  |	|Data          |    |  Type  |
|-----------|---|--------------|----|--------| 
| epicRating|	|1 to 10       | 	| Number |
| hasAnimals|	| true or false| 	|Boolean |


, the constructor function is defined using a function expression. In other words, the variable EpicFailVideo is declared and then assigned a function with two parameters called epicRating and hasAnimals.


Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

## Basic Table Structure
`<table>` , `<tr>` ,`<td>` ,`<th>`
These elements help people 
who use screen readers and also 
allow you to style these sections 
in a different manner: `<thead>`
`<tbody>`
`<tfoot>`
## FUNCT IONS, METHODS & OBJECTS
Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the 
browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These 
built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages. 
You access their properties or methods using dot 
notation, just like you would access the properties or 
methods of an object you had written yourself
toolkit has three compartments :
1. BROWSER OBJECT 
MODEL 
2. GLOBAL JAVASCRIPT 
OBJECTS 
3. DOCUMENT OBJECT 
MODEL 
### USING THE BROWSER OBJECT Model : 
 to update the value of an object properties we use dot notation or square brackets to delete property we use delete key object constructors are used as a template for creating objects Arrays are considered as an objects,the tool when write object have three compartments
browser object model
document object model
global javascript objects
