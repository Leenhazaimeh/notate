# Stacks and Queues
What is a Stack ?
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

# Common terminology for a stack:


Push :    Nodes that are put into the stack
Pop :   Nodes that are removed from the stack
Top :   This is the top of the stack
Peek  :  view the value of the top Node in the stack.
IsEmpty  :  returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO : First In Last Out
LIFO : Last In First Out


# What is a Queue ?
Common terminology for a queue:


Enqueue:    Nodes that are put into the queue
Dequeue :   Nodes that are removed from the queue
Front  :  This is the front/first Node of the queue.
Rear  :  This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
Peek  :  view the value of the top Node in the queue.
IsEmpty   : returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
Queues follow these concepts:

FIFO : First In First Out
LILO : Last In Last Ou
