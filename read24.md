# Ethics
self-driving technology creeps into vehicles, the debate over 
how they should behave in situations they can't anticipate is sharpening.

Multiple studies estimate that autonomous cars would dramatically reduce road accidents – up to 90 per cent, according to a 2015 report by McKinsey & Company.
## Code of Ethics
Ethical behavior ensures that staff completes work with honesty and integrity and meets the aim of an organization by adhering to rules and policies.
Employees who are ethically positive, honest, hardworking, and driven by principles of fairness and decency in the workplace, 
increases the overall morale and enhances the performance of an organization.

    **Challenges "like ethics, regulations, infrastructure and societal readiness" may take longer to resolve than the technology to develop,
    Toyota's Hutchinson said. "These are big questions, and it's going to take the combined efforts of governments,
    insurance companies, manufacturers and all kinds of associations to answer them." and implement systems that are robustly and usably secure. 
    "People felt like they weren't as much in control as to when they communicated with people, but we adapted," she says. "That feeling itself is socially
    constructed and there will be some replacement feeling of control in the future, it just won't look the way it does today."

# Ethics in Technology
cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars, with a particular focus on how carmakers are working to keep autonomous vehicles
safe from hackers. A cyber incident is a problem for every automaker in the world," General Motors CEO Mary Barra said in a speech last year.
"It is a matter of public safety." How are automakers working to ensure that malicious actors do not take remote control of self-driving cars and, say,
turn them into weapons of terror? I am not sure the security problem can solely be solved by regulation. The government, in my opinion, needs to be involved, 
but it is incredibly difficult to test an existing complex system and certify that it is secure. Rather, 
I think the government could check if car manufacturers are adhering to some predefined secure coding practices while ensuring 
they have taken some basic security precautions.
Imagine if
It’s a bright, sunny day and you’re alone in your spanking new self-driving vehicle, sprinting along the two-lane Tunnel of Trees on M-119 high above Lake Michigan north of Harbor Springs. You’re sitting back, enjoying the view. You’re looking out through the trees, trying to get a glimpse of the crystal blue water below you, moving along at the 45-m.p.h. speed limit.

As you approach a rise in the road, heading south, a school bus appears, driving north, one driven by a human, and it veers sharply toward you. There is no time to stop safely, and no time for you to take control of the car.
Does the car:
