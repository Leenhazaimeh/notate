`<img>`: an empty used to add images .

src:  tells the browser where 
it can find the image file



alt:text description 
of the image.



title : provide additional information .

>  Where an image is placed 
in the code will affect how it 
is displayed. Here are three 
examples of image placement 
that produce different results:
1: before a paragraph
The paragraph starts on a new 
line after the image.
2: inside the start of a 
paragraph
The first row of text aligns with 
the bottom of the image.
3: in the middle of a 
paragraph
The image is placed between the 
words of the paragraph that it 
appears in.


## align :  how 
the other parts of a page should 
flow around an image.
1. left
This aligns the image to the left 
(allowing text to flow around its 
right-hand side)
2. right
This aligns the image to the right 
(allowing text to flow around its 
left-hand side).

Three Rules for 
Creating Images:

1. Save images in 
the right format
2. 2
Save images at 
the right size
3. Use the correct
resolution
* **Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs**



# Chapter 11: “Color”
 (pp.246-263)

 How to specify colors ?


rgb values,hex codes,color names

Color terminology and contrast !!




Background color !!
>  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA

> It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise 
people will not be able to read your content).
X CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to 
indicate opacity. 


# Chapter 12: “Text”

 (pp.264-299)


 1. Size and typeface of text
2. Bold, italics, capitals, underlines
3. Spacing between lines, words, and letters




If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.
and You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and wordsText can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented
You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of element .



# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF :

* Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. it's support transparency by declaring a single colour or  inserting an alpha channel mainly have two modes of clors


*JPJ images don’t support transparency and are hence not usable for such cases,can support around 16 million colours.

* Use GIF format for images that contain animations.and support transparency by declaring a single colour in the colour palette,are limited to 256 colours

* In lossless compression, you can reconstruct the original image from the compressed image .



*Animation*

 *refers to any change or movement in the image*
