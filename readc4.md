# React and Forms
 

 ### React Docs - Forms


 In React, when handling a form, you’d want a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form. The function will have access to the form data entered by the user. This technique is called “controlled components”.

 ` the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”. `


A Controlled Component is nothing but a technique of controlling the value of form input elements by Recat.
 The handleChange will keep the React state updated. You can actually type something and see the console logging the most recent value every single time.
